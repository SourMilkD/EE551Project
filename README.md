# EE551Project
EE 551 - Project

My EE551 Project is a text based adventure game.

Use terminal to run the Python Script and make sure it's version 3+.

The game is dictated and paced through your own inputs and decisions.

Using functions and if/else statements I created different story lines.

Every decision you make results in a different outcome for your "adventure".

The game progresses using print statements to inform you of what's going on creates the flow of the game.

Using the input function, the game prompts decisions that are stored into variables that are later checked in if/else statements to determine the different path you would be taking.

The formate function was utilized to show that the script kept track of your decisions and it would reused the variables that were set by you.

A function from time was used to create delays so the text was not bombarded on the player and instead created a more steady flow of the game.
